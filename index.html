          <h3>When Life Was Full There Was No History</h3>
          <p>In the age when life on earth was full, no one paid any special attention to worthy men, nor did they single out the man of ability.  Rulers were simply the highest branches on the tree, and the people were like deer in the woods.  They were honest and righteous without realizing that they were “doing their duty.”  They loved each other and did not know that this was “love of neighbor.”  They deceived no one yet they did not know that they were “men to be trusted.”  They were reliable and did not know that this was “good faith.”  They lived freely together giving and taking, and did not know that they were generous.  No one gave thought to the narration of a hero, because they were all heros.  For this reason they made no history. <span class="attribution" > ~ Chuang Tzu</span></p>
